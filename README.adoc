= .NET Microservice and Docker

This is a sample project for a microservice written in .NET Core 2.2 and C# that accesses a Postgres DB. The goal of this project is to establish a smooth process for test drive development (TDD) of the microservice leveraging the power of Docker container and the `docker-compose` tool.
